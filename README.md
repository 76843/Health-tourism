Create a platform for connecting People with health problems to tier 2 hospitals  with quality care over the world at relatively low cost

There are lot of developing countries like India where the quality of medical service is on par with the developed countries, while being less painful to the pocket.

This platform solves two problems:
1. It eases the pressure on the hospitals in developing countries financial constraints by bringing in new revenue sources
2. It is very helpful for the people in the developed world where the medical costs are sky rocketing.

This is a vast employment generator for the developing world, improves international relations of countries and gives the people world over different perscepective of the countries.
